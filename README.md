# DISASTER TWEETS CHALLENGE - BLOC 4

## Project goals ðŸŽ¯
Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency theyâ€™re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).

But, itâ€™s not always clear whether a personâ€™s words are actually announcing a disaster. In this competition, youâ€™re challenged to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which oneâ€™s arenâ€™t. Youâ€™ll have access to a dataset of 10,000 tweets that were hand classified.
